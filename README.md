So. I'm plannning to make a simple clone of google's homepage. It's gonna take some time, cause freecodecamp wasn't that good at teaching and I wasn't good at repeating the subjects that I already learned by myself.

But nonetheless, I will make the best clone of google's homepage and one day in future I'll comeback and make it better.
